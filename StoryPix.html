    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p class ="spaced-line">
      This was my first professional project, where I joined Underdogs Studio as a Junior Game Programmer. 
      I had the opportunity to work alongside incredibly talented developers and receive valuable mentorship from senior team members.
    </p>
    <p class ="spaced-line">
      During my initial month,I explored new features and techniques while learning the whole development pipeline. 
      This allowed me to contribute meaningfully early on including proposing a new set of rules to streamline and improve the story flow system.
    </p>
    <p class ="spaced-line">
      These are some of the key features I worked on:

    <section class = "tech-notes">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Addressables & AWS integration</strong>: Used Unity Addressables to upload story bundles to AWS, letting the app download episode assets on demand so users only download what they play.</li>
        <li><strong>Extended Fungus Visual Scripting</strong>: Built custom editor extensions for Fungus, 
                    adding new node types and utilities to the flowchart interface so non-programmers can craft complex dialogue branches and events without touching code.</li>
        <li><strong>Automated Doc‐to‐Interactive Story</strong>: Contributed in automatic the process of converting story docs files to working stories in unity 
                                                                where docs were color coded by designers which then is converted in csv file
                                                               with commands and signs which then used in unity to generate story flow</li>
        <li><strong>UI programming</strong>: Implemented in-game interfaces for navigating episodes, 
                                              displaying dialogue, and handling player choices.</li>
