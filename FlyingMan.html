      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Fly Me Hard is a fast-paced, physics-driven action game where you play as a jetpack-wielding cowboy fighting through waves of goblins, 
        skeletons, and magical foes across medieval landscapes. As the Sole Developer, I built core mechanics such as active ragdoll physics, 
        dynamic enemy AI, and more.

  <!-- Introduction -->
  <section class="Heading">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class ="spaced-line">
      This project began as a personal learning experiment—I just wanted to get a better grasp of physics concepts in Unity. 
      But as development progressed, I stumbled upon a pretty unique mechanic that felt like it could evolve into a full-fledged game.
    </p>
    <p class ="spaced-line">
      As a solo developer, I handled everything from programming and design to art direction. This gave me a deeper appreciation for the challenges faced in each area—especially how tough design and artistic decisions can be. The experience gave me a holistic understanding of game production, 
      which later helped me collaborate and communicate more effectively with my team at work.  
    </p>
    <p class ="spaced-line">
      To top it off, the game was picked up by CrazyGames publishers, 
      and my inbox was soon filled with feedback and love from players—which was an incredibly rewarding moment.

    <h2>Grid Based Optimization</h2>
    <img class="Image-moreFeatures"
      src="assets/Grid Based Optimization.png"   <!-- path to your image file -->
    </img>
    <p class ="spaced-line">
      In some levels, there are 15–25 enemies, each having multiple rigidbodies and joints with IK animations, causing performance bottlenecks—especially on the web platform.
    </p>
    <p class ="spaced-line">
      To solve this, I built a custom grid-based optimization system that automatically stores playable objects based on their position in the grid. Each cell contains playable objects (enemies, props, etc.) and they are only activated when the player enters the cell, as shown in the picture above.
    </p>
    <p class ="spaced-line">
      Red cells in the grid represent unvisited areas (objects are inactive), and green areas represent visited ones (objects are active).

      <h3>Tech Notes:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Event-Driven Architecture:</strong>
           It’s all powered by <code>WantedStarSystem</code> that tracks your wanted level and fires events when crime is committed such as 
          <code>OnWantedStarAdded(int wantedLevel)</code> and <code>OnResetWantedStar()</code>. The <code>WantedLevelManager</code> ties it all together—handling crime thresholds, triggering police spawners, and cleaning up when you escape or get busted.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Object Pooling:</strong>  
        Spawners use coroutines for controlled, performant instantiation and recycling of police entities when escaping.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Adaptive Spawning:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Singleton Persistence:</strong> Inherits from <code>MonoBehaviourSingletonPersistentNoLoad</code> for scene changes</li>
            <li><strong>Coroutines for Smooth Performance:</strong> Delays in both spawning and death cleanup</li>
            <li><strong>NavMesh SamplePosition:</strong> Spawn Police AIs at a random position in the navMesh area such as road to avoid overlaps on obstacle and gives clear paths to player.</li>
            <li><strong>Player-View Exclusion:</strong> Simple dot-product trick keeps Ais spawning behind the player or at a far distance.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
