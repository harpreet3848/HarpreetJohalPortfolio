    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p class ="spaced-line">
      This is one of the exciting hyper-casual games I had the opportunity to work on during my time at Underdog Studio, in collaboration with a partnered mobile game publisher.
      The core concept of the game revolves around high-speed downhill racing on high mountain slopes, 
      where players must build momentum, take strategic jumps off cliffs, 
      and glide through the air to outpace AI opponents and reach the finish line.
    </p>
    <p class ="spaced-line">
      The game focuses on fast-paced, physics-driven gameplay with short, satisfying races perfect for mobile audiences. 
    </p>
    <p class ="spaced-line">
       This project was handed to me during its prototype stage, which meant a lot of core systems had to be reworked, polished, and brought to production quality. 
       I closely collaborated with designers throughout development to improve the feel, flow, and overall gameplay experience.
       These are some of the features I remember working on ->
        <section class = "tech-notes">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Player Mechanics:</strong> I worked on responsive movement system, momentum based flying, mid air control</li>
        <li><strong>AI rivals:</strong> Worked on AI opponents that uses same movement mechanics as the player, using inheritance with shared physics behavior,
                                         along with basic AI navigation controls with some constraints</li>

      <h3>Tech Notes:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Event-Driven Architecture:</strong>
           It’s all powered by <code>WantedStarSystem</code> that tracks your wanted level and fires events when crime is committed such as 
          <code>OnWantedStarAdded(int wantedLevel)</code> and <code>OnResetWantedStar()</code>. The <code>WantedLevelManager</code> ties it all together—handling crime thresholds, triggering police spawners, and cleaning up when you escape or get busted.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Object Pooling:</strong>  
        Spawners use coroutines for controlled, performant instantiation and recycling of police entities when escaping.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Adaptive Spawning:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Singleton Persistence:</strong> Inherits from <code>MonoBehaviourSingletonPersistentNoLoad</code> for scene changes</li>
            <li><strong>Coroutines for Smooth Performance:</strong> Delays in both spawning and death cleanup</li>
            <li><strong>NavMesh SamplePosition:</strong> Spawn Police AIs at a random position in the navMesh area such as road to avoid overlaps on obstacle and gives clear paths to player.</li>
            <li><strong>Player-View Exclusion:</strong> Simple dot-product trick keeps Ais spawning behind the player or at a far distance.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
