      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Fly Me Hard is a fast-paced, physics-driven action game where you play as a jetpack-wielding cowboy fighting through waves of goblins, 
        skeletons, and magical foes across medieval landscapes. As the Sole Developer, I built core mechanics such as active ragdoll physics, 
        dynamic enemy AI, and more.

  <!-- Introduction -->
  <section class="Heading">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class ="spaced-line">
      This project began as a personal learning experiment—I just wanted to get a better grasp of physics concepts in Unity. 
      But as development progressed, I stumbled upon a pretty unique mechanic that felt like it could evolve into a full-fledged game.
    </p>
    <p class ="spaced-line">
      As a solo developer, I handled everything from programming and design to art direction. This gave me a deeper appreciation for the challenges faced in each area—especially how tough design and artistic decisions can be. The experience gave me a holistic understanding of game production, 
      which later helped me collaborate and communicate more effectively with my team at work.  
    </p>
    <p class ="spaced-line">
      To top it off, the game was picked up by CrazyGames publishers, 
      and my inbox was soon filled with feedback and love from players—which was an incredibly rewarding moment.

      Games like human fall flat, 
      Gang beasts uses this mechanic to create hilarious, unpredictable physics based moments and
      I wanted kind of same fun interative experience for my game.

      Characters use Configurable Joints between each bone, with proper spring and damping settings after lot of trail to follow animator pose
      but with flexible physics based movement.

    <h2>Multi-Scene Workflow System</h2>
    <img class="Image-moreFeatures"
      src="assets/MultiSceneWorkFlow.png"   <!-- path to your image file -->
    </img>
    <p>
        To improve loading efficiency and make the development pipeline smoother, 
        I implemented a multi-scene workflow in my game. 
        Instead of loading entire levels as a single scene, I broke the game into modular scene groups:
    </p>
    <section class = "tech-notes">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bootstrapper</strong>: Handles persistent systems (e.g. Api handlers,core managers)</li>
          <li><strong>BaseGame</strong>: Core gameplay logic, loaded additively across all levels</li>
          <li><strong>UI</strong>: Persistent UI elements (menus, HUD)</li>
          <li><strong>Level_x</strong>: Specific level content</li>
        </ul>
     <section>

      <p>
        Using this system, I built a custom <strong>Scene Group Loader Tool</strong>
        that allows quick switching between levels directly in the editor. This gave me:
      </p>
      <section class = "tech-notes">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Faster iteration</strong> – Test specific levels without restarting the whole game</li>
          <li><strong>Better memory management</strong> – Only active scenes are kept in memory</li>
          <li><strong>Scalable structure</strong> – Easy to add new levels and features without breaking core systems</li>
          <li><strong>Smaller scene sizes</strong> – Scenes are split by responsibility, improving load speed</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Grid Based Optimization</h2>
    <img class="Image-moreFeatures"
      src="assets/Grid Based Optimization.png"   <!-- path to your image file -->
    </img>
    <p class ="spaced-line">
      In some levels, there are 15–25 enemies, each having multiple rigidbodies and joints with IK animations, causing performance bottlenecks—especially on the web platform.
    </p>
    <p class ="spaced-line">
      To solve this, I built a custom grid-based optimization system that automatically stores playable objects based on their position in the grid. Each cell contains playable objects (enemies, props, etc.) and they are only activated when the player enters the cell, as shown in the picture above.
    </p>
    <p class ="spaced-line">
      Red cells in the grid represent unvisited areas (objects are inactive), and green areas represent visited ones (objects are active).

      There are lot of others systems as well made to polish and finish the game

      <h3>Tech Notes:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Event-Driven Architecture:</strong>
           It’s all powered by <code>WantedStarSystem</code> that tracks your wanted level and fires events when crime is committed such as 
          <code>OnWantedStarAdded(int wantedLevel)</code> and <code>OnResetWantedStar()</code>. The <code>WantedLevelManager</code> ties it all together—handling crime thresholds, triggering police spawners, and cleaning up when you escape or get busted.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Object Pooling:</strong>  
        Spawners use coroutines for controlled, performant instantiation and recycling of police entities when escaping.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Adaptive Spawning:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Singleton Persistence:</strong> Inherits from <code>MonoBehaviourSingletonPersistentNoLoad</code> for scene changes</li>
            <li><strong>Coroutines for Smooth Performance:</strong> Delays in both spawning and death cleanup</li>
            <li><strong>NavMesh SamplePosition:</strong> Spawn Police AIs at a random position in the navMesh area such as road to avoid overlaps on obstacle and gives clear paths to player.</li>
            <li><strong>Player-View Exclusion:</strong> Simple dot-product trick keeps Ais spawning behind the player or at a far distance.</li>
          </ul>
