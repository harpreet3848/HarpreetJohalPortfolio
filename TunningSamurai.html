    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p class ="spaced-line">
This was a fun Game Jam project I made with a designer and artist during BYOG 2022. 
I built a playable prototype and polished in just 48 hours.
    </p>

    <p class ="spaced-line">
      Game Theme was “it does sound like me” and we came with an 
      idea after lot of brainstorming and notes making we came up 
      with idea where You play as a blindfolded samurai 
      in training who can’t see and he can only hear sounds and frequency 
      of other enemies like heartbeat (3D sound) and weapon frequency (where I have used sin waves for visuals representation)

      Combat consists of matching sound frequencies with enemies in order to strike where they fluctuate based on the weapon and type of the enemy. If missed enemy will attack instead and you will be dead.
    </p>

    <p class ="spaced-line">
      The levels also had light puzzles where you had to pick the right weapon to match frequency to destroy blocks and progress through the training.

    <p class ="spaced-line">
       Even though I barely slept during this game jam, it was totally worth the effort as we received a lot of love from the community, and it was among the top 5 most rated games!
